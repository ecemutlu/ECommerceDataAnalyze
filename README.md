# ECommerceDataAnalyze
E-commerce has revolutionized the way businesses operate and how customers shop for goods. It offers businesses a wider market reach, cost-effective distribution, and convenience for consumers. This dataset captures sales transactions from a London-based e-commerce store specializing in gifts and homeware for adults and children. Customers are both individual buyers and small businesses reselling products through retail channels.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 500,000 rows and 8 columns, detailing sales transactions over one year. Below is a description of the key features:

TransactionNo: A unique identifier for each transaction (categorical). Transactions with "C" indicate cancellations.
Date: The date of the transaction (numeric).
ProductNo: A unique identifier for each product (categorical).
Product: The name of the product or item (categorical).
Price: The price per unit of the product (Â£) (numeric).
Quantity: The number of units purchased per transaction (numeric). Negative values indicate cancellations.
CustomerNo: A unique identifier for each customer (categorical).
Country: The country of the customer (categorical).
Note: Some transactions were canceled due to out-of-stock products, as customers prefer consolidated deliveries.
